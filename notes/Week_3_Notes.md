# Notes
- Focusing on leetcode and DSA for projects and scripts moving forwards

# leetcode
- Learned difference between sets and lists in usage
- Strenghtened understanding of test cases and time/space complexity
- Strengthened understanding of arrays, specifically intersections
- Pracitced with sliding windows and subarrays

# DSA
- Learned about dunder and magic methods, and why/how they function


# Python
- print vs return vs yield
- enumerate recap(again) * 2
- ord and how it works
- defaultdict from collections
- zip and count
- sliding windows vs brute force with every subarray
