# Notes
- Focusing on more leetcode problems this week, and creating a script to help me decide what to do with my leisure time

# Leetcode
- Reinforcing differences between hashmap windows and two pointer windows.


# Project
- I imagine using my hashmap structure created in repo to store a dict of games and categories/requirements, perhaps as a json file.
- I then use a random package, after learning about it, to decide what game to play, dependent on what i have the capacity for
- Future func can include productive vs leisure, and other similar ideas.
