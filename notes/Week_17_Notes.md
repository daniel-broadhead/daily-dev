# Notes
- Searching 2d matrix is just removing 1 row/column at a time and shrinking the work space. 
- python really is easy mode for coding. building a min stack is just using prebuilt python functions to duplicate a stack
- list functions as stack. append/pop. decode str with stack func, 1 ch at a time
- use stack to find running totals of rectangles/heights. stacks are great for calculations. pop removes the top/last added value. lifo
- matrices can be mentally reframed into rectangles or other shapes. don't get intimidated by them
- heaps have properties that allow finding elements without sorting the original list. builds the 'tree' and sorts items under the hood.
