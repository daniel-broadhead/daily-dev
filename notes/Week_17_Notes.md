# Notes
- Searching 2d matrix is just removing 1 row/column at a time and shrinking the work space. 
- python really is easy mode for coding. building a min stack is just using prebuilt python functions to duplicate a stack
- list functions as stack. append/pop. decode str with stack func, 1 ch at a time
