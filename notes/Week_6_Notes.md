# Notes
- Focusing on coding logic and understanding. May delve into C/C++ for a current class.

# Leetcode
- Prefix_table and practice of hashmaps more. 
- Caught up on using an else, rather than an elif, which led to error cases. 
- 3 sum practice for 2 pointer problems and logic
- More 2 pointer practice, with permutations
- Linked lists

# Projects
