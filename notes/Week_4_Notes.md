# Notes
- Focusing on Leetcode and strenghtening understanding of DSA

# Leetcode
- Median of two sorted arrays. Touched on binary search and partitioning for time efficient soln. 
- Array practice including pascal's triangle and Kadane's algorithm
- learned some about the 3 power problem. 
- practice with re package. practice with indices and data types
- 2 pointer problem with moving zeroes, tricky soln for my brain
- strings are immutable. learned more string methods
