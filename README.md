## 👨‍💻 About Me

I'm Daniel, a stay-at-home dad with a BS in Chemistry, now pursuing a Master's in Computer Science at CU Boulder.  
My goal is to finish by **January 2027** and transition into a tech career by **May 2027**.

This repo documents my growth — one script, one project, and one day at a time.
