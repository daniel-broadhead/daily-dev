# Description
- This is a little project, coming from the timeless struggle of not knowing what game I should play when I have free time.
- Using a PRNG and the hashmap structure I've created, I will input a library of games, along with requirements for that game
- The script will ask the user what requirements I have(time, baby, etc) and will give me what game to play.
- 

# Future Func
- Perhaps something to actually run the program from CMD after the game is chosen
- Function to remove something(since i added same game under slightly different names)

# Notes
- Because this calls the hashmap function from data_structures, it requires running the script as -m to navigate to the correct folder
with correct permissions. 
- python -m scripts.game_picker.update_library
