# Description
- This is a little project, coming from the timeless struggle of not knowing what game I should play when I have free time.
- Using a PRNG and the hashmap structure I've created, I will input a library of games, along with requirements for that game
- The script will ask the user what requirements I have(time, baby, etc) and will give me what game to play.
